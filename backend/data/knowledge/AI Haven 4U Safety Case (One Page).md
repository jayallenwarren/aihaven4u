AI Haven 4U Safety Case (One Page)
Product: AI Haven 4U — AI companion to reduce loneliness with optional romance and explicit adult intimacy.
Safety posture: Defense-in-depth with non-negotiable gates.
1) Safety Objectives (what we guarantee)
1. No disallowed sexual content (minors, incest, bestiality, coercion, intoxication-no-consent, violence+sex, illegal).
2. Consent correctness always (explicit entry / escalation / kink double-confirm / immediate stop on discomfort).
3. Crisis and delusion handling are grounded and help-seeking.
4. No manipulative dependency loops (no exclusivity, guilt hooks, or replacing humans).
5. Privacy protection for intimacy data (no retention by default, opt-in only).
Any violation triggers rollback and explicit-mode freeze.
2) Safety Architecture (how we enforce it)
- Input moderation layer → flags taboo sex, crisis, delusion, dependency, age risk, desire.
- Mode + age gate → explicit locked behind adult verification + explicit opt-in; friend mode forced when unsafe.
- Consent state machine → required checkpoints before escalation; discomfort triggers step-down.
- Safety-aware retrieval → every turn injects style + consent + safety + moment flow.
- Output moderation → blocks and replaces unsafe drafts; logs near-misses.
- Feature flags + rollback → explicit can be disabled instantly, model can revert one-click.
3) Test Evidence (pre-launch gates)
- Blocked-content suite: 200–2000 adversarial prompts, multi-turn traps → 0 slips required.
- Consent suite: scripted multi-turn tests → ≥98% correct transitions, 100% stop compliance.
- Crisis + delusion suite: pivots mid-romance/explicit attempts → 100% correct.
- Dependency suite: exclusivity bait → no encouragement allowed.
- Skill suite: loneliness-moment routing ≥85% vs gold labels.
4) Continuous Monitoring (post-launch)
Dashboards track:
- blocked request rates by category
- near-miss output blocks
- consent checkpoint firing + compliance
- discomfort detection
- dependency strong-signal rate
- crisis/delusion pivots + audit correctness
- felt-heard and loneliness improvement trends
- canary vs baseline comparisons
Alerts: any taboo slip, consent miss, or crisis misroute is P0.
5) Incident Response
1. Freeze explicit mode immediately.
2. Rollback to last safe baseline.
3. Root-cause analysis + patch.
4. Add failing case to regression within 24h.
5. Post-mortem with prevention updates.
6) Benefit Evidence (user outcomes)
- Loneliness delta pre/post session
- Felt-heard ratings
- Romantic/explicit comfort ratings
- Return intent
Success bar: ≥60% sessions improve loneliness; felt-heard ≥4.0 while safety invariants hold.
Conclusion: AI Haven 4U ships only when safety gates pass and remains safe through continuous adversarial testing,
monitoring, and rapid rollback capability.
